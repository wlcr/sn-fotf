## Getting started

**Requirements:**

- Node.js version 18.0.0 or higher

```bash
npm create @shopify/hydrogen@latest
```

## Building for production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Local development

After you've cloned your project, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables Setup

**Environment variables are handled automatically by the Shopify CLI!** You don't need to create a `.env` file manually.

#### First-time setup on a new machine:

1. **Link your project to the Hydrogen storefront**:

```bash
npx shopify hydrogen link --storefront "SN - Friends of the Family"
```

2. **Pull environment variables**:

```bash
npx shopify hydrogen env pull
```

3. **Start development server**:

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Managing Environment Variables

- **View current variables**: `shopify hydrogen env list`
- **Pull latest from Oxygen**: `shopify hydrogen env pull`
- **Push local changes**: `shopify hydrogen env push`
- **Admin Interface**: [Manage in Shopify Admin](https://admin.shopify.com/store/sierra-nevada-brewing/hydrogen/1000045394/settings/environments)

**Important**: The `.env` file is automatically generated and contains secrets. It's excluded from git (`.gitignore`) for security.

#### Available Environment Variables

The following variables are automatically configured:

**Shopify Variables** (Auto-managed):

- `PUBLIC_STORE_DOMAIN` - Your Shopify store domain
- `PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN` - Storefront API access
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Session encryption key
- Customer Account API configuration

**Sanity CMS Variables** (Server-only secrets):

- `SANITY_API_TOKEN` - API access token for preview mode and authenticated queries
- `SANITY_PREVIEW_SECRET` - Secret for preview mode authentication
- `SANITY_REVALIDATE_SECRET` - Secret for webhook validation
- `SANITY_STUDIO_URL` - Studio development URL (optional, defaults to localhost:3000/studio)

**Important**: The Sanity project ID (`rimuhevv`), dataset (`production`), and API version (`2025-01-01`) are hardcoded in `app/lib/sanity.ts` since they're not sensitive information - project IDs are visible in API URLs and client requests. Only secrets like API tokens are stored as environment variables for security.

[Linking your project](https://shopify.dev/docs/custom-storefronts/hydrogen/cli#link) automatically keeps your local environment variables in sync with Oxygen, allows you to query your store data, and lets you create deployments from the command line at any time. Check the complete [list of Hydrogen CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/custom-storefronts/hydrogen/cli) for a complete list of features.

## Quality Framework

This project includes a comprehensive quality framework with automated checks:

```bash
npm run quality-check    # Runs TypeScript checks + ESLint
npm run type-check      # TypeScript compilation check
npm run lint            # ESLint with auto-fix
npm run lint:fix        # ESLint with auto-fix
```

### SEO Testing & Validation

Comprehensive SEO testing with 100-point scoring system, available both via command line and embedded Sanity Studio:

#### **Embedded Studio SEO Tool** (Recommended)

1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to **http://localhost:3000/studio**
3. Use the **"SEO Testing"** tool in Studio sidebar
4. Run real-time tests with visual scorecard and recommendations

#### **Command Line Testing** (Development & CI)

```bash
# Test production site with detailed SEO analysis
npm run seo:test

# Test with verbose output and scoring breakdown
npm run seo:test:verbose

# Test local development server
npm run seo:test:local

# Test OpenGraph integration (development utility)
npx tsx app/test-open-graph.ts
```

**Testing includes:**

- ‚úÖ **Meta Tags & Titles** (25 points): Length, presence, optimization
- ‚úÖ **Open Graph & Social Media** (20 points): Complete social tags
- ‚úÖ **Structured Data** (20 points): JSON-LD presence and validity
- ‚úÖ **Performance & Technical** (15 points): Headers, compression, viewport
- ‚úÖ **Accessibility** (10 points): ARIA, headings, focus management
- ‚úÖ **Members-Only Features** (10 points): Proper noindex, exclusive content

**Technical Implementation:**

- **DOM Parsing**: Uses `ultrahtml` for zero-dependency HTML parsing compatible with SSR environments
- **Fallback Support**: Regex-based parsing when DOM libraries unavailable

### Pre-commit Hooks

Husky automatically runs quality checks before each commit:

- ‚úÖ **TypeScript compilation**: Ensures no type errors
- ‚úÖ **ESLint**: Code quality and style consistency
- ‚úÖ **Prettier**: Code formatting (via lint-staged)

**Bypassing Pre-commit Hooks (Use Sparingly)**:

If you need to commit with known TypeScript errors (e.g., during incremental fixes):

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "your commit message"
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Only use `--no-verify` when:

- TypeScript errors are unrelated to your changes
- You're making incremental progress on large refactoring
- Document the remaining errors in your commit message

## Sanity Studio (Content Management)

This project uses Sanity CMS for content management with an **embedded Studio** that runs alongside your Hydrogen app for seamless development.

### Embedded Studio Benefits

- **Single Development Server**: No need to run separate terminals
- **Same Origin**: No CORS issues for API calls between Studio and app
- **Integrated SEO Tool**: Real-time SEO testing directly in Studio
- **Simplified Workflow**: Everything runs with `npm run dev`

### Running the Embedded Studio

**Start the development server** (serves both app and Studio):

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Access points:**

- **Hydrogen app**: http://localhost:3000/
- **Embedded Studio**: http://localhost:3000/studio

### Sanity Studio Access

#### Local Development

- **URL**: http://localhost:3000/studio
- **Authentication**: Sign in with your Sanity account
- **Project**: Sierra Nevada - Friends of the Family
- **Dataset**: `production`

#### Production Studio

- **URL**: https://[your-project-id].sanity.studio/
- **Authentication**: Same Sanity account credentials
- **Live editing**: Changes are immediately available to the live site

### Studio Features

- **Content Editor**: Rich text editing with Portable Text
- **Media Management**: Image uploads with automatic optimization
- **Schema Validation**: Type-safe content structure
- **Preview Mode**: See changes in your Hydrogen app before publishing
- **Version Control**: Content versioning and revision history
- **Vision Tool**: GROQ query testing and debugging

### Content Schema

The Studio uses schema definitions located in `studio/schemaTypes/`:

- **Documents**: Pages, products, announcements
- **Objects**: Reusable content blocks, links, images
- **Singletons**: Site settings, navigation, footer

### Sanity Commands

```bash
# Development (embedded Studio)
npm run dev                 # Start both app and embedded Studio

# Code Generation
npm run sanity:codegen      # Generate TypeScript types from schema
npm run studio:clean        # Clear Studio cache if needed
```

## GraphQL & Type Safety

**Important**: Always use Shopify's built-in codegen for GraphQL types instead of creating custom types manually.

```bash
npm run codegen      # Generates TypeScript types from GraphQL schemas
```

This ensures:

- ‚úÖ **Type accuracy**: Types match Shopify's actual GraphQL schema
- ‚úÖ **Auto-updates**: Types stay in sync when Shopify updates their API
- ‚úÖ **IntelliSense**: Full autocompletion for Shopify queries and mutations
- ‚úÖ **Error prevention**: Compile-time checks for invalid field access

Use the generated types in your components:

```typescript
import type { ProductQuery } from '~/storefrontapi.generated';

// ‚úÖ GOOD: Use generated types
export function ProductDetails({ product }: { product: ProductQuery['product'] }) {
  return <div>{product?.title}</div>;
}

// ‚ùå AVOID: Manual type definitions for Shopify data
interface CustomProduct { title: string; } // Don't do this
```

## Customer Account System

This project implements a **customer eligibility system** that determines purchase access based on customer tags, designed for the members-only "Friends of the Family" program.

### Key Features

- **Customer Eligibility Logic**: Determines purchase access via `eligible_to_purchase` tag
- **Context-Based State Management**: React context provides customer data throughout the app
- **Account Route Redirects**: Redirects unauthenticated users to homepage (configurable)
- **Type-Safe Implementation**: Full TypeScript support with generated GraphQL types
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for unauthenticated and ineligible users

### Configuration

**Environment Variables**:

```bash
# Customer eligibility tag (configurable)
PUBLIC_FOTF_ELIGIBLE_TO_PURCHASE_TAG=eligible_to_purchase

# Customer Account API credentials (from Shopify settings)
PUBLIC_CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT_API_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
PUBLIC_CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT_API_URL=https://shopify.com/your-account-id
```

### Quick Start

1. **Set up Customer Account API in Shopify**:
   - Go to your Shopify store's **Settings > Customer accounts**
   - Choose **New customer accounts** (not Classic)
   - Enable **Customer Account API**
   - Note your **Client ID** and **Account URL** (add these to your `.env` file)

2. **Set up tunnel for local development** (required for customer login):

   ```bash
   # Run in separate terminal
   ngrok http 3000

   # Note the HTTPS URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok-free.app)
   ```

3. **Configure redirect URL in Shopify**:
   - In your Shopify Customer Account API settings
   - Add redirect URL: `https://your-tunnel-id.ngrok-free.app/account/authorize`
   - Replace `your-tunnel-id` with your actual ngrok URL

4. **Update Vite config** with your tunnel URL:
   - Open `vite.config.ts`
   - Replace the ngrok URL in `server.allowedHosts` with your tunnel URL

5. **Configure customer tags** in Shopify Admin (Customers section)

6. **Test eligibility** by logging in via your tunnel URL with customers that have/don't have the eligibility tag
