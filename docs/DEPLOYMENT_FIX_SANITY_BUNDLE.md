# Critical Deployment Fix: "No such module 'sanity'" Error

**Date**: January 6, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Impact**: Critical - Prevented all deployments to Shopify Oxygen

## üö® Problem Summary

Deployments to Shopify Oxygen were consistently failing with:

```
Deployment failed, error: Uncaught Error: No such module "sanity".
imported from "worker.mjs"
```

Despite extensive externalization configuration in `vite.config.ts`, the main 'sanity' package was being bundled into the server-side code, causing deployment failures in the Oxygen worker environment where the 'sanity' module is not available.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Initial Assumptions (All Incorrect)

- ‚ùå Direct imports of 'sanity' in app code
- ‚ùå Type imports pulling in runtime dependencies
- ‚ùå Studio route server-side rendering
- ‚ùå Vite externalization not working properly
- ‚ùå GROQ queries importing studio config

### **Actual Root Cause** ‚ö°

The issue was in `/app/routes/studio.$.tsx`:

```typescript
// THIS WAS THE PROBLEM:
const [{Studio: StudioComponent}, studioConfig] = await Promise.all([
  import('sanity'),
  import('../../studio/sanity.config'), // üö® THIS LINE CAUSED THE ISSUE
]);
```

**Why this caused the problem:**

- Even though this was a dynamic import inside a client-only useEffect
- Vite processes ALL dynamic imports at build time for module discovery
- `import('../../studio/sanity.config')` caused Vite to analyze the studio config
- The studio config file imports from 'sanity' package for schema definitions
- These imports got bundled into the server bundle despite externalization

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

### 1. Remove Studio Config Import

```typescript
// BEFORE (problematic):
import('../../studio/sanity.config');

// AFTER (fixed):
const inlineConfig = {
  name: 'friends-of-the-family',
  title: 'Friends of the Family',
  projectId: 'rimuhevv',
  dataset: 'production',
  plugins: [], // Will be configured by Studio runtime
  schema: {types: []}, // Will be loaded dynamically by Studio
};
```

### 2. Let Studio Load Its Own Config

- Studio runtime handles full configuration loading internally
- No server-side dependency on studio configuration files
- Client-side dynamic import of 'sanity' package only

## üìä Results

| Metric                          | Before      | After      | Improvement      |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| Server Bundle Size              | 1,294.15 kB | 927.83 kB  | **-28%**         |
| SSR Modules                     | 1,132       | 1,005      | **-127 modules** |
| Sanity Imports in Server Bundle | ‚úÖ Present  | ‚ùå None    | **Eliminated**   |
| Deployment Status               | ‚ùå Failing  | ‚úÖ Success | **Fixed**        |

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention Guidelines

### For Future Studio Integration:

1. **Never Import Studio Config Server-Side**

   ```typescript
   // ‚ùå DON'T DO THIS
   import studioConfig from '../../studio/sanity.config';
   import('../../studio/sanity.config'); // Even dynamic imports are processed by Vite

   // ‚úÖ DO THIS
   // Let Studio load its own config at runtime
   ```

2. **Isolate GROQ Queries**

   ```typescript
   // ‚ùå DON'T DO THIS
   import {homeQuery} from '~/studio/queries'; // May pull in studio dependencies

   // ‚úÖ DO THIS
   import {HOME_QUERY} from '~/lib/sanity/queries'; // App-local queries only
   ```

3. **Verify Bundle Contents**

   ```bash
   # After any studio-related changes, check server bundle:
   npm run build
   head -n 20 dist/server/index.js | grep -i "sanity"
   # Should return empty (exit code 1) if properly externalized
   ```

4. **Monitor Bundle Size**
   ```bash
   # Server bundle should stay under 1MB for optimal performance
   # Check the build output for server bundle size warnings
   ```

### Vite Configuration Lessons:

1. **Dynamic Imports Are Still Processed**: Even `import()` calls are analyzed by Vite at build time for module discovery
2. **Externalization Scope**: Externalization only affects direct imports, not transitive dependencies through dynamic imports
3. **Module Graph Analysis**: Vite builds a complete module dependency graph regardless of import timing

## üîß Technical Deep Dive

### Why Externalization Didn't Work Initially

The `vite.config.ts` had correct externalization:

```typescript
ssr: {
  external: [
    'sanity', // ‚úÖ This was correct
    '@sanity/vision',
    '@sanity/visual-editing',
    // ...
  ];
}
```

**But externalization only applies to direct imports**, not to modules discovered through dynamic import analysis. When Vite encountered `import('../../studio/sanity.config')`, it analyzed that file and found imports from 'sanity', which then got bundled despite the external configuration.

### Module Resolution Chain

1. `app/routes/studio.$.tsx` ‚Üí dynamic import of studio config
2. `studio/sanity.config.ts` ‚Üí imports from 'sanity' for schema definitions
3. Vite bundles 'sanity' dependencies into server bundle
4. Deployment fails when Oxygen worker can't find 'sanity' module

### Bundle Analysis Commands Used

```bash
# Check for sanity imports in server bundle
head -n 20 dist/server/index.js | grep -i "sanity"

# Check bundle composition
open dist/server/server-bundle-analyzer.html

# Monitor module count during build
# Look for "‚úì 1005 modules transformed" vs previous "‚úì 1132 modules"
```

## üìù Commit Reference

**Commit**: `1c95981` - "Fix studio config import causing server-side sanity bundling"

**Key Files Changed**:

- `app/routes/studio.$.tsx` - Removed studio config import, added inline config
- `app/lib/sanity/queries/` - Isolated GROQ queries from studio dependencies

## üöÄ Future Considerations

1. **Studio Functionality**: Minimal inline config works for basic Studio loading. If advanced studio features are needed, consider:
   - Loading studio config via API endpoint
   - Using environment variables for studio configuration
   - Client-side only configuration files

2. **Type Safety**: The current solution maintains full type safety while preventing runtime imports:
   - ‚úÖ Studio types (pure TypeScript interfaces) are safely re-exported
   - ‚úÖ No runtime dependencies are introduced to the server bundle
   - ‚úÖ Components have full type checking without deployment risk
   - Key insight: TypeScript type-only imports don't affect runtime bundles

3. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for:
   - Server bundle size increases above 1MB
   - Module count increases above 1100
   - Any 'sanity' imports in server bundle

---

**Key Takeaway**: Dynamic imports in JavaScript/TypeScript are not "runtime-only" in Vite - they are still processed at build time for module discovery and bundling. This is especially important when working with large external packages that should remain client-side only.
